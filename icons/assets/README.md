# Assets

This directory contains source files and exported assets for the development workflow.

## Folders

### Source Files (`source-files/`)
Original design files and editable assets:
- **Design Files**: PSD, AI, Sketch, Figma exports
- **Vector Sources**: Original SVG files with full editing capability
- **Templates**: Base templates for creating new icons
- **Style Guides**: Visual style reference files

### Exported (`exported/`)
Processed and optimized files ready for distribution:
- **Optimized Icons**: Compressed and web-optimized versions
- **Icon Packages**: Bundled icon sets for easy deployment
- **Build Artifacts**: Generated icon files from automated processes
- **Distribution Packages**: Ready-to-use asset packages for applications

## Workflow

### Design Process
1. Create/edit icons in `source-files/` using appropriate design tools
2. Export initial versions to `exported/` for testing
3. Optimize files for target platforms and use cases
4. Deploy optimized assets to appropriate application folders

### File Management
- Keep source files for all icons to enable future modifications
- Maintain version control for design iterations
- Document export settings and optimization processes
- Archive old versions when making significant changes

### Automation
This folder structure supports automated build processes that can:
- Generate multiple icon sizes from source files
- Optimize images for different platforms
- Create distribution packages
- Update application icon sets automatically
